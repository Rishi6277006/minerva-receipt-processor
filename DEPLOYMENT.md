## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend to Railway**
2. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel**
3. **Connect them with environment variables**
4. **Test all functionality**

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If Vercel shows 404:
- Check Root Directory setting (should be `.`)
- Verify `package.json` is in root
- Check build logs for errors

### If Backend fails to deploy:
- Check Railway logs
- Verify `packages/backend/package.json` exists
- Check environment variables

### If Frontend can't connect to Backend:
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is set correctly
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Test backend URL directly
